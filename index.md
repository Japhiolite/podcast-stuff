# Welcome to a Zylonensender 

This quick'n'dirty webpage is a presentation of [Jan's](https://japhiolite.github.io/) analysis of the [Zylonensender](https://zahlensender.net/bsg/), where he is one of the podcasters. The podcast is about Battlestar Galactica, and after each episode, the podcasters give a rating. 

So after the whole series is watched, we'll have a short look at the overall ratings. We'll have a look at questions like:  
- Who has been attending the most / least in the podcast?
- What's the distribution of our ratings (we rated between 0 and 10 points)?  
- What has been the best episode? What has been the worst? 
- How do we compare to the IMDb ratings?

## Analysis  
The analysis is done using python and presented as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
